# Technicalities

Due to the complex nature of the simulation, there are a number of technical decisions that may impact the model performance or results. This chapter contains the technical documentation concerning these decisions.

## Random Numbers

A single random number generator is used for the entire life cycle of the simulation The simulation class `Random` acts as a wrapper for [GNU Scientific Library Random Number Generation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/rng.html) and [Random Number Distributions](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/randist.html). The simulation uses the Mersenne Twister 19937 generator (`gsl_rng_mt19937`) which produces 32-bit numbers with a state size of 19937 bits. Unless a seed is provided by the configuration, the random number generator instance is seeded by `std::random_device` which produces a non-deterministic, uniformly-distributed integer value.
